 * Provides an interface for implementors of vision systems to implement. The

 * Functions in this interface are expected to be able to move the machine as
 * needed. For instance, getFiducialLocations may make multiple passes at
 * finding a fiducial while moving the camera closer each time.
 * 
 * Concrete classes should provide configuration options for tuning the
